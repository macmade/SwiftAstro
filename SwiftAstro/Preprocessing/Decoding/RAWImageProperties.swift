/// SwiftRAW's `RAWFile` is a non-`Sendable` reference type that owns a LibRAW
/// instance, so it cannot cross a concurrency boundary. The sensor's 16-bit

/// captured, which is all a consumer needs to decode the pixels — the RAW
/// analogue of ``XISFImageProperties`` / ``BitmapImageProperties``.
///
/// The samples are the cropped mosaic in host byte order (the bytes are produced
/// and consumed in-process), one 16-bit sample per pixel (``width`` × ``height``
/// samples). They are the raw sensor values — linear, undemosaiced, with no white
/// balance or tone curve applied — so they flow through the pipeline exactly like
/// a colour-filter-array FITS sub.
